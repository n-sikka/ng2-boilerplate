# Angular 6 Enterprise Scale Boilerplate

This project is created using the Angular CLI. All the `ng` commands work with this. 
It is modular and has lazy loaded modules in the route. The application is for big projects that require high optimization in terms of chunking. 

Each module is a page and each page has its facades and services. Core module contains the app api endpoint configuration and the application uses Bootstrap 4 as base skin with little optimization
